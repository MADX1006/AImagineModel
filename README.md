## 🌐 Overview

Traditional threat modeling is manual and time-consuming.  
**AImagineModel** leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to automate the identification of threats in the **WebSure web application**, using structured data and AI-based predictions.

This helps:
- Developers secure applications faster  
- Identify vulnerabilities such as spoofing, tampering, data leakage, and denial of service  
- Reduce time spent on manual STRIDE threat modeling

## ✨ Features

✔️ AI-powered threat prediction for web applications  
✔️ Support for WebSure data inputs (e.g., JSON, configs, flows)  
✔️ Auto-generated threat reports with suggested mitigations  
✔️ Simple interface for developers and security teams  
✔️ Easily extendable to other applications beyond WebSure
